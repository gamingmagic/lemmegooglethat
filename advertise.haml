          %p There are 9 ad slots, each one costing $199.  If you buy 1 ad slot, then your ad will be shown to about 1 out of every 9 visitors.  You can purchase multiple ad slots to increase your ads frequency.

      %h1 Ad Program Details

      %h2 Impressions
      %p There are only nine advertising slots available each month for the entire site. To increase your impact, only a single ad will be shown for each page viewed. Buying a month's slot gives you an exclusive showing on a minimum of eleven percent of all the impressions for that month. And there won't be Google or other third-party ads diluting your exposure. Your ad is the only ad on the page.
      %p We're not selling ads based on page views, hits or click-throughs, but if we were, the CPM would be below industry norms. Ad slots are sold at a fixed price per month. We do this for simplicity sake, both for us and so you can easily predict your marketing budget. LMGTFY serves millions of impressions each month.

      %h2 Pricing
      %p The current rate for ads is $199 USD per slot per month and this rate is subject to change.  You may purchase up to 12 months worth of slots in advance, effectively locking the rate for those 12 months.
      %p Additionally, purchasing 3 or more ads slots at once not only locks in your price for that time period, but we will also give you a 10% discount on the total.

      %h2 Stats
      %p At the end of each month, we will send you an email telling you:
      :markdown
        * how many times your ad was displayed
        * how many times your ad was clicked
        * your calculated CPM

      %h2 Details
      %p The nine ad slots are in rotation each month. The ads are 120 pixels wide by 90 pixels tall and also allow for up to 80 characters of text to accompany the image which allows advertisers to give their ads a bit more impact. We reserve the right to round the corners of your ad so we can provide a consistent look and feel for our site. We also display the ad slightly subdued until someone hovers over the ad. This creates a "visual pop" which increases the click-thru rate.
      %p Ads are only displayed to creators of LMGTFY queries, not the "victims".

      %h2 Legalese
      %p Ads will only be marked for display after payment is received. Payment must be made via PayPal or in the form of a check.
      %p We reserve the right to approve or deny any ad for any reason. Pricing and policies are subject to change, but once you're paid and locked in for a particular month, you are guaranteed that slot.
      %p If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;%61%64%73@%6c%6d%67%74%66%79.%63%6f%6d?subject=Advertising%20on%20LMGTFY">contact us</a>.
